My personal Minecraft adaptation of the Roblox Game Deepwoken from team Vows of the Sea managed by Ragoozer. While I have recently come to understand there is a different adaptation already present on curseforge (curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deepwoken-craft) I intend to make my as-faithful-as-possible adaptation via my own means. I will try to avoid this other project as much as possible in order not to steal from their creations, but some overlap will inevitably occur.

Project will later be avaliable on:
